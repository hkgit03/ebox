# Ebox
Switch between emacs distributions.

I used this as a bash-script before, installed by my [config](https://github.com/hkgit03/config), then realized [someone had already written something like this before](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/emacs-distribution), but wrote it anew anyway in order to have it as a standalone binary which does not depend on a shell, let alone because it's supposed to run on MS Windows too, one day.

My earlier script version of this was called *eswitch*, but since this program is intended to be a complete Emacs sandbox later (i. e. multiple emacs instances running different distributions in parallel, without interference), I renamed it to Ebox. Also, `ebox` is easier to type on a command line.
